The actual site I've used so far: https://ww12.readonepiece.com/

What this app does differently is that it slides the pages left-to-right. I believe it provides a little better experience.

To fetch One Piece chapters from there, I had to set up a Cloudflare Worker as a proxy.

For the logo as well as some stylized texts, I used this: https://www.textstudio.com/logo/one-piece-logo-759

I also used a One Piece font: https://fontmeme.com/fonts/one-piece-manga-font/

Also, here's the gun that appears on first pages of every volume that I used for indicating the left/right direction: https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fivr9lypipk591.png%3Fwidth%3D315%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D646579de2e8f6e47f13da56efc5f2a335e63a2b8

For Turkish translation, I used MangaDenizi:

- Colored up to 838: https://www.mangadenizi.net/manga/one-piece-renkli
- Black & white for the rest: https://www.mangadenizi.net/manga/one-piece
